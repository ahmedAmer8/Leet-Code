# LeetCode Solutions in Python

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! 🚀 Here, I solve all LeetCode problems in Python and organize them into three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

## 📂 Folder Structure
The problems are categorized as follows:
- `Easy/` - Solutions to easy-level problems.
- `Medium/` - Solutions to medium-level problems.
- `Hard/` - Solutions to hard-level problems.

Each problem is named according to its LeetCode title and is implemented in a Python script.
